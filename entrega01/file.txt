----- tim mcgraw -----

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie."
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie.

----- picture to burn -----

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
[Album version line:] That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
[Music video version line:] That's fine you won't mind if I say
By the way...

[Chorus:]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn!

There's no time for tears,
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]

And if you're missing me,
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard,
I really really hate that...

[Chorus]

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

----- teardrops on my guitar -----

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,
And she's got everything that I have to live without.

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny [radio version]
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny [CD version]
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus:]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]

So I drive home alone.
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight.

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into.

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.

----- a place in this world -----

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus:]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's ok

[Chorus]

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,
Oh I'm just a girl

----- cold as you -----

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus:]

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Repeat Chorus]

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

----- the outside -----

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus:]

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

[Repeat Chorus]

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

----- tied together with a smile -----

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, cause I know you...

[Chorus:]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go... and no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay
Not his price to pay...

[Chorus x2]

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone... oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby

----- stay beautiful -----

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

[Chorus:]
You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey, by the way...

[Chorus]

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold,
At least you'll know...

You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for,
I hope your life lead you back to my front door.
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na

----- should've said no -----

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

[Chorus:]
You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, with what you did with her,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

[Chorus]

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this:
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No... no, no, no...

----- mary's song -----

[Chorus]She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I...
Oh my my my my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my...

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my...

----- our song -----

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

[Chorus:]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah.

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

----- i'm only me when i'm with you -----

Friday night beneath the stars,
in a field behind your yard,
you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.
And sometimes we don't say a thing;
just listen to the crickets sing.
Everything I need is right here by my side.
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you.

[Chorus:]
I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me when I'm with you.

Just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world.
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.
And I don't try to hide my tears.
The secrets or my deepest fears.
Through it all nobody gets me like you do.
And you know everything about me.
You say that you can't live without me.

[Chorus]

When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
Only you can tell.

[Chorus:]
That I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Uh huh
Yeah

----- invisible -----

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.
Shell never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by.

And you cant see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me.

[Chorus:]
I just wanna show you
She dont even know you,
She's never gonna love you like I want to.
And you just see right through me.
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

Theres a fire inside of you
That cant help but shine through.
Shes never gonna see the light
No matter what you do.

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, were invisible.
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize.

I just wanna show you
She dont even know you.
Baby, let me love you,
Let me want you.
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.

----- a perfectly good heart ----- 

[Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away.
It don't make sense to me, but:

[Repeat Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore.
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus 2:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

[Repeat Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

----- jump than fall -----

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me
Cause Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
And people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please,
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all

And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
You can Jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

----- untouchable -----

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway
But you're untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

Oh, In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

Oh, oh I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh oh

Oh, Oh, In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

Like a million little stars, spelling out your name
Spelling out your name

----- forever and always -----

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

----- come in with the rain -----

I could go back to every laugh,
But I don't wanna' go there anymore,
And I know all the steps up to your door,
But I don't wanna' go there anymore.

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky,
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find.

Ill leave my window open,
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name.
Just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

I could stand up and sing you a song,
But I dont wanna have to go that far.
And I, Ive got you down,
I know you by heart,
And you dont even know where I start.

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears,
Talk to the man who put you here,
And dont wait for the sky to clear.

Ill leave my window open,
Cus Im too tired at night to call your name.
Oh, just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

Ive watched you so long,
Screamed your name,
I dont know what else I can say.

But Ill leave my window open,
Cus Im too tired at night for all these games.
Just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

I could go back to every laugh,
But I dont wanna go there anymore

----- superstar -----

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar

----- the other side of the door -----

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again.
I mean it, I mean it."
What I mean is...

I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

----- fearless -----

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss,
It's flawless,
Really something,
It's fearless.

Oh yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Oh-oh
Oh yeah

----- fifteen -----

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
"You know I haven't seen you around before."

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.

----- love story -----

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello, "
Little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.

'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me,
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Oh, oh, oh.

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

----- hey stephen -----

Hey Stephen,
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you.
And as we walked
We were talking 
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Hey Stephen,
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Hey Stephen,
I've been holding back this feeling.
So I've got some things to say to you, ha.
I seen it all 
So I thought 
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name 
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Hey Stephen,
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.

[Chorus]

They're dimming the street lights.
You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.

Hey Stephen,
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose.
All those other girls 
Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus:]
I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself...
...if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Myself,
Can't help myself,
I can't help myself.

----- white horse -----

Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known

[Chorus:]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

[Chorus:]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
They're in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now

----- you belong with me -----

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.

But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
"Hey, isn't this easy?"

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

You belong with me.

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me.

----- breath -----

I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.

Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.

Ohhh

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

I'm sorry (oh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry

----- tell me why -----

I took a chance, I took a shot 
And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not 
You took a swing, I took it hard 
And down here from the ground I see who you are 

I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
I'm feeling like I don't know you 
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you're around 
And here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why.. 

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day 
Well I get so confused and frustrated 
Forget what i'm trying to say, oh 

I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
I got no one to believe in 
You tell me that you want me, then push me around 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you're around 
Here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why.. 

Why..do you have to make me feel small 
So you can feel whole inside 
Why..do you have to put down my dreams 
So you're the only thing on my mind 

I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
I'm feeling like I don't know you 
You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
I've got no one to believe in 
You ask me for my love then you push me around 
Here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why 
Why, tell me why 

I take a step back, let you go 
I told you i'm not bulletproof 
Now you know

----- you're not sorry -----

All this time I was wasting,
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no oh

Looking so innocent,
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no, oh

You're not sorry no no oh

You had me crying for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no oh

You're not sorry, no no oh

----- the way i loved you -----

He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and it's like 
I couldn't ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
He's close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
He's charming and endearing 
And I'm comfortable 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He can't see the smile I'm faking 
And my heart's not breaking 
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now 

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
I'm so in love that I acted insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you

----- forever and always (piano version) -----

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night,
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me?
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
I don't think so

Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
You said forever and always... yeah

----- the best day -----

I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now -- the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and window-shop
Until I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
Now at school
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today

----- change -----

And its a sad picture,
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know its all the same,
Another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah

So weve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Were getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But were faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
This revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

----- you all over me -----

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath reminds me of you

You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been reminds me of me

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your: Don't you wish you had me grin
But I did, so I smiled and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

And I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me

----- mr perfectly fine -----

Mr. Perfect face
Mr. Here to stay
Mr. Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I've been waiting for you all my life
Mr. Every single day until the end, I will be by your side

But that was when I got to know Mr. Change of heart
Mr. Leaves me all alone, I fall apart

Hello, Mr. Perfectly fine

He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest
I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm around a brand new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through

So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room

Oh, he's so smug, Mr. Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then you'll be Mr. Too Late

Goodbye, Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

Goodbye, Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine
You're perfectly fine

Mr. Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
You said you'd never go away

----- we were happy -----

We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy

We were happy
Oh, oh, oh
We were happy

----- that's when -----

You said: I know
When I said: I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
You watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said: When can I, I, I come back?

And you said: That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Hmm, hmm

I said: I know
When you said: I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said: Leave those all in our past
And you said: When can I, I, I come back?

And I said: That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when

And you say: Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?
And I said

That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing, when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when

----- don't' you -----

Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just something I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say: We're still friends
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again

Don't you (don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (don't you) say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (you don't) know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you, ah, ah, ah

----- bye bye baby -----

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

----- mine -----

Uh, oh, oh
Uh, oh, oh

You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As were lying on the couch
The moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Flash forward and were taking on the world together,
And theres a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded,
You say well never make my parents mistakes.

But we got bills to pay,
We got nothing figured out,
When it was hard to take,
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the "Goodbye."
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "Ill never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, its like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.
She is the best thing thats ever been mine."

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

(Hold on) do you believe it?
(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
(Hold on) and I can see it,
(Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)

----- sparks fly -----

The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something,
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

Drop everything now,
Meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk,
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
And the sparks fly...

----- back to december -----

I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier than ever,
We small talk, work and the weather,
Your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
Realized I loved you in the fall.

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time.

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry.

Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
So if the chain is on your door I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time.
All the time.

----- speak now -----

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus:]
Dont say "Yes", run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me,
Dont you?

[Chorus:]
Dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
Dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
Theres the silence, theres my last chance.
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only looking at you.

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus:]
So, dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Lets run away now,
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door.
Baby, I didnt say my vows,
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."

----- dear john -----

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through, again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home, I should've known.

Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so, I should've known.

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you've burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shouldve known.

You shouldve known
Dont you think I was too young?
You shouldve known.

----- mean -----

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well you can take me down with just one single blow
But you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so?...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

----- the story of us -----

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
How we met and the sparks flew instantly,
and people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.

Oh, a simple complication,
Miscommunications lead to fall-out.
So many things that I wish you knew,
So many walls up I can't break through.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

Next chapter.

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
And you're doing your best to avoid me.
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
But you held your pride like you should've held me.

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,
I've never heard silence quite this loud.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

This is looking like a contest,
Of who can act like they care less,
But I liked it better when you were on my side.
The battle's in your hands now,
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight.
So many things that you wish I knew,
But the story of us might be ending soon.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.
And we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

The end.

----- never grow up -----

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

----- enchanted -----

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity,
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey,
It was enchanting to meet you,
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

----- better than revenge -----

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did"

Ha!
Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
Come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

----- innocent -----

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been.
You're still an innocent,
You're still an innocent.

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did.
You're still an innocent.

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent.
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent.
You're still an innocent.

Lost your balance on a tightrope.
It's never too late to get it back.

----- haunted -----

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No.

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it...

----- last kiss -----

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last...

----- logn live -----

I said remember this moment in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment, promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

----- ours -----

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

----- if this was a movie -----

Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me,
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
Not before I knew how much I had to lose."

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there,
If you're somewhere,
If you're moving on,
I've been waiting for you.
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before.
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said, "It's not that easy."
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now

----- superman -----

Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you? "
I say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around...
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

When you come back down

----- state of grace -----

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

----- red -----

[Verse 1:]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2:]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge:]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus:]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Post-Chorus:]
And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

----- treacherous -----

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away,
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow,
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

----- i knew you were trouble -----

[Music video spoken part:]
I think--I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Music video spoken part:]
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.

----- all too well -----

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow.
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer even now.

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

And I know it's long gone,
And that magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay,
But I'm not fine at all.

'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to...

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

----- 22 -----

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Uh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Uh oh! (hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news.
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news,
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

----- i almost do -----

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess, babe,
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.

----- we are never ever getting back together -----

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space. (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together,
We are never ever ever getting back together,
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever...

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never..."
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"

No!

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
We, ooh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

----- stay, stay, stay -----

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
I threw my phone across the room at you.
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
But you stayed.

This morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
Who took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.

You took the time to memorize me:
My fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' out with you all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave;
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.

Stay.
And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

[Background:] That's so fun!

----- the last time -----

[Gary Lightbody:]
I find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,
I'm not sure how I got there,
All roadsthey lead me here.

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better,

[Both:]
and right before your eyes,
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why,
Just you and me.

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[Taylor Swift:]
You find yourself at my door,
Just like all those times before,
You wear your best apology,
But I was there to watch you leave,

And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better.

[Both:]
and right before your eyes,
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide,
Just you and me...

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...

[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time I let you in my door,
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.

Oh, oh, oh,

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye.

[4x:]
This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this...

----- holy ground -----

I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light "Go".
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made,
And that was the first day.

And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you,
And for the first time I had something to lose,
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
And the storys got dust on every page,
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
And I see your face in every crowd.

Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you,

It was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.

----- sad beautiful tragic -----

Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had  a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

----- the lucky one -----

New to town with a made up name in the angel's city,
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.

You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixties queen.

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...

Now its big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

And they tell you that youre lucky.
But youre so confused,
'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive.

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now.

Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

Yeah theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

----- everything was changed -----

[Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Ed Sheeran]
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

[Taylor Swift (Album version) / Ed Sheeran (Remix version):]
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
[Album version:] Taking flight, making me feel right
[Remix version:] Taking flight, making me feel right like

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Bridge]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind.

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
All I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello."
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

----- starlight -----

I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window,
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

----- begin again -----

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

----- the moment i knew -----

You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there's one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you",
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.
Ooh,

You called me later,
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew.

----- come back... be here -----

You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached,"
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can't put this down,
If I had known what I'd known now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in London today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you when you are worlds away.

New York... be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here.
Come back... be here.

----- girl at home -----

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that.

I don't even know her,
But I feel a responsibility,
To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

So don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you've got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And tell her you're coming home,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

It would be a fine proposition,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

----- welcome to new york -----

Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud
Heartbeats under coats
Everybody here
Wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't
Heard before
And it said

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on
Apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else
Before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and
Girls and girls

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love it keeps you
Guessing
Like any real love
It's ever changing
Like any true love

It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't
Change anything anything
Anything

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright
They never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

----- blank space -----

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

----- style -----

Midnight,
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive,
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style.

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I...
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah.
Just take me home
(out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

----- out of the woods -----

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus 2x:]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance,
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

[Chorus 2x]

(Are we out of the woods?!)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me,
I remember, oh, I remember

----- all you had to do was stay -----

[Chorus 4x]People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Let me remind
You this was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

----- shake it off -----

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates [chuckle]
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Yeah ohhh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

----- i wish you would -----

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room.
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would

----- bad blood -----

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
Mhmmm
If you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
(Hey)

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

----- wildest dreams -----

He said, "Let's get out of this town,
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
I thought heaven can't help me now.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.

I said, "No one has to know what we do, "
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.

----- how you get the girl -----

Oh oh oh.
Oh-oh.

Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane ('ane)?"
Say it's been a long 6 months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want.

And that's how it works.
That's how you get the girl.
And then you say,

"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I would wait forever and ever."

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...

Remind her how it used to be (yeah, yeah)
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks)
Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh)
When you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).

And that's how it works.
That's how you lost the girl.
And now you say,

"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever),
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)."

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah)

And you could know (oh-oh oh oh)
That I don't want you to go oh-oh..

Remind me how it used to be.
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
And say you want me.
Yeah...

And then you say,

"I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better),
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I want you forever and ever."

[4x]
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl.
Oh.

That's how it works.
That's how you got the girl.

----- this love -----

Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams,
in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you're still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip,
oh, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]

Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... 

----- i know places -----

You stand with your hand on my waist line
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out 

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time 

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places 

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places

----- clean -----

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean

10 months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Think I'm finally clean

----- wonderland -----

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole.

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control.

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night.

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed.

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams.

Oh

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.

But darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

----- you are in love -----

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burn toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says
You're my best friend
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

----- new romantics -----

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded,
It's so romantic

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

----- ready for it? -----

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holding him for ransom, some
Some boys are trying too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor (hey!)
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure (hey)
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

----- end game -----

[Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation (git, git)
Ah, and I heard about you
Ooh, You like the bad ones, too (yeah)

[Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (yeah)
I'm in a G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it, too 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down, and I protect you with my life (my life)

[Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee-deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you, I don't wanna miss you
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Aah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (hey!)
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Aah, and I heard about you
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too

[Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang! We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Taylor Swift, Future & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (me and you) (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now) (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (oh, I do!) (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

----- i did something bad -----

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look, oh so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly him all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it coming what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says: Don't throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name then I owe him nothing
And if he spends my change then he had it coming

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up, light me up, light me up
Go ahead and light me up
Light me up, light me up, light me up, light me up

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good? (so good)
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, (good) good

Oh, you say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good?
It just felt so good, good

----- don't blame me -----

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh-whoah-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

[Outro]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

----- delicate -----

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
('Cause I like you)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
('Cause I like you)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?

----- look what you made me do -----

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me—)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

----- so it goes -----

[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

[Bridge]
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting? (One, two, three)

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place (Pieces fall)
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
I do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

----- gorgeous -----

[Intro]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous

----- getaway car -----

[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We’re both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

----- king of my heart -----

[Verse 1]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "Baby" like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once
[Verse 2]
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once
[Bridge]
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

----- dancing with our hands tied -----

[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

[Chorus]
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)

----- dress -----

[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about—
[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha...

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops...
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Outro]
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

----- this is why we can't have nice things -----

[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

----- call it what you want -----

[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want... to

----- new year's day -----

[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

----- i forgot that you existed -----

[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show
[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah

----- cruel summer -----

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil
[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

----- lover -----

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

----- the man -----

[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I’d be the man
I'd be the man

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)
[Outro]
If I was a man, then I'd be the man

----- the archer -----

[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay
[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat

----- i think he knows -----

[Verse 1]
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)
[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

[Bridge]
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows
[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows

----- miss americana and the heart break prince -----

[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know

[Outro]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"

----- paper rings -----

[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Outro]
You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

----- cornelia street -----

[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

[Outro]
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

----- death by a thousand cuts -----

[Intro]
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?
[Chorus]
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

----- london boy -----

[Intro: Idris Elba & James Corden]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)
[Outro]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

----- soon you'll get better -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
[Bridge: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

----- false god -----

[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah
[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

----- you need to calm down -----

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

----- afterglow -----

[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

----- me -----

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like
[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

----- it's nice to have a friend -----

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

----- daylight -----

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)
[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

----- the 1 -----

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

----- cardigan -----

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

----- the last great american diynasty -----

[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time

----- exile -----

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

----- my tears ricochet -----

[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

----- mirrorball -----

[Verse 1]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

----- seven -----

[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Bridge]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
[Verse 2]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long

----- august -----

[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

----- this is me trying -----

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying

----- illicit affairs -----

[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times

----- invisible string -----

[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)

------ mad woman -----

[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that

----- epiphany -----

[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)
[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

----- betty -----

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

----- peace -----

[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

----- hoax -----

[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

----- willow -----

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

----- ​champagne problems -----

[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

----- ​gold rush -----

[Intro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

[Outro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

----- ​'tis the damn season -----

[Verse 1]
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Outro]
It always leads to you and my hometown

----- ​tolerate it -----

[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
[Bridge]
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

[Chorus 2]
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Outro]
I sit and watch you

----- ​no body, no crime -----

[Intro: HAIM]
He did it
He did it

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

[Outro: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died

----- happiness -----

[Verse 1]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

----- dorothea -----

[Verse 1]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

[Chorus]
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything

[Verse 2]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show

[Chorus]
But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah

----- ​coney island -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold

----- ivy -----

[Verse 1]
How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours
[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you
[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you
In you

----- cowboy like me -----

[Verse 1]
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Chorus]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Verse 3]
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

[Chorus]
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me

[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Chorus]
You're a cowboy like me

[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Bridge]
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

[Verse 4]
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

[Chorus]
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
[Outro]
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again

----- long story short -----

[Verse 1]
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready
[Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Bridge]
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

[Verse 3]
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you
(And now) Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Outro]
Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived

----- marjorie -----

[Verse 1]
Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Verse 2]
Never be so politе
You forget your power
Nevеr wield such power
You forget to be polite
[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Bridge]
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me
[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Outro]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around

----- closure -----

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure

[Verse 2]
Don't treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears, and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing bettеr
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your lеtter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure
Your closure, your closure
[Bridge]
I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, closure, your closure
Your closure

----- evermore -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

[Bridge 1: Justin Vernon]
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

[Bridge 2: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore

----- more -----

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

wahooahoo

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not cause were just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on youtube

Cause, Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancingI wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy, 
Thinking about him

I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]

There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be

[Chorus]

I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right nowSometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveAmerican boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the dream of an american boy

American boy, raising little babies
hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
that's grown up, american boy

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
the hope of an american boyWell, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girlAngelinas got a pretty face
And really long brown hair

And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
Hes got everything youd wanna be
Hes funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I wont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But aint it funny how
It all comes out
Isnt life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless

Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say

Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean,
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?

At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

Oh, yeah, yeah

You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge - Taylor Swift (Kendrick Lamar):]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
(Think we can solve 'em!)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done

Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!Your beautiful eyes

You're here, You're eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before

In only a little while... I'll cry
Cause you're my lullaby

Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about

Dream about your eyes
Eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyesAll is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my babyHer hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
Hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you, she'll unease you
Just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you when she snows you
She knows you, she's got Bette Davis EyesI live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

All my friends are saying 
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, 
you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone

All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know betterHere you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
BreathlessEmily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."

She said, "I wish there was some way
To make them stop it."
So he drives down to
That principles office and says,

"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down.
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out.
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile.
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
And he said,

"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down.
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out.
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile.
So don't let nobody take that away.
You weren't brought up that way."

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's officer Tate."
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident.
You better come down here right away.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
And Emily  she's fading fast."

He says, "God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down.
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground.
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile.
So please don't take that away.
It won't be easy taking her today.
She wasn't brought up that way."

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyesI had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say 
I'm looking good

But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number; just in case
I still miss you
And i still love you
By the way
By the way, ohAny day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well thats good enough for me
Dont need the real thing
Thats just another thing 
For me to try to tame
Dont know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

Before I met him 
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But Ill never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see meI'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus:]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus]

Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier.Ive been counting days and
Ive been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
Ive been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
Cause Ive been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if youve seen one
Id like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonightHe said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue TennesseeShe walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you?
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

He kissed his wife good bye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said,
"We're here to die for our God."
He stood up and said, "That's funny,
'Cause my God died for me."

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you?
And didn't he pray too?

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down

And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you? Where were you?
And didn't they pray too?

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every dayMy momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew 
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eyeHere in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me 
When we started home it started to rain 
You put your coat around me 
We stood there in the road 
You held me so close 
But did you ever let go 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
The bitter sting of what we couldve been 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

In through the window I see her with you 
Im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry 
I guess the storm is over for you 
But look at the tears here in my eyes 
I just stood there like a ghost 
As you held her so close 
And as I let you go 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Love like this changes who you are 
Every kiss you gave me is a scar 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

All I need is to move on fast 
But all I want is to have you back 
And it just keeps falling 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
The bitter sting of what we couldve been 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

Down came the rain[Spoken:] You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey 

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated 

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.

Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

(Keep your eyes open [4x])

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes openIsn't it funny how many times we can say,
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car,
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh,

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me,
Fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on youSomeone struck a match against the night,
All I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.

For a while I thought that I could hold you,
But you were just a temporary high. 

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free,
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand,
I tried to catch you, but I can't 
Chase the wind

And just as I reach out to touch you,
I remind myself you were meant to fly.

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you,  firefly
FireflyMy name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kinda scared 'cause
I never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
And she says that

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
An' I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
But none of us want to get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we doWish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something i just fell into, 

And it was over-rated
But just look what i've created
I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue

Before you ask me if i'm alright, 
Think about what i, 
Had to do-oo, yeah

Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess i didn't plan, 
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me, 
Wish you could only see, 
I've got an i heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand.

I'd be fine if you just walked by, 
But you had to talk about why, 
You were wrong and i was right, 

But i can't believe you made me, 
Sit at home and cry like a baby, 
Wait right by the phone every night, 

And now you ask about you and i, 
There's no you and i, 
Remember what you put me through, 
I had to, 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Fix my heart put on my make-up, 
Another mess i didn't plan, 
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an i heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand 

And when you're home alone at night, 
You'll still wonder 
Why you took everything i had, oh baby
I had a lot about you and i, 
There's no you and i, 
And i know, 
Someday you will...

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planed, 

And you'll know you didn't beat me, 
When you look down and see, 
I've got an i heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand, 

Written on the back of my hand
An i heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand[Taylor Swift:]
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] I told you I was, I was) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

[Sammy Adams:]
Double platinum wherever she go
South of France to Reno
Met her out in Vegas
Went in on casino 
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad, bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate...just yet
Slow down, I know that 
You thinking you and me...just met 
But girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy

Some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
And ya feel the same way, same way 
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man 
I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn
And I can care less that your famous
We can make the perfect couple
Cause my first name big, last name trouble
Yeah

[Taylor Swift:]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, troubleI like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream

I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see

Dont try me
Dont fight me
You be you and Ill be me

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you

Your mum and daddys walls
Are covered up in pictures of you

You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into

So sorry, dont worry
Im sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you
And it aint you oh

Oh baby, dont persuade me

So let me say it real slow

They say Ive always known

And they say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
And youll will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint youI... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the skyThrowing pennies at the fountain, 
When you're standing on a mountain, 
It's kinda hard to aim. 

But like the trees we cut our names in, 
There must be an explanation, 
Guess it didn't given off rain. 
I need reasons why you're leaving 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
I thought was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really from your heart 
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought was a star. 

Diving off into the deep end, 
Honestly believe you'd be there, 
When I jumped in, 
Is ain't your territory, 
We had the perfect love story, 
except ending. 
Nothing comes true, 
When it comes to you. 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really from your heart 
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star. 

And I was too cloudy, 
It's not my fault I just couldn't see. 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
I thought it was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star. 

Throwing pennies at the fountain, 
When you're standing on a mountain, 
It's kinda hard to aim.I dont think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
Hell never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs
And...

[Chorus:]
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
Id lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldnt a light go on?
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine

[Chorus]

He stands there, then walks away
My god if I could only say,
"Im holding every breath for you..."

Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is "My god, hes beautiful."
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
Id lieShe didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing whyI got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ohCome on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went outThere's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you

Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you ain't so far away

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky youYour feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

Do you know when you go 
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Made Up You

Oh oh

Made Up YouHe's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine

People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolinMe and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
Or where else to go

Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

Oh, oh
Were not as young, but were still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when were old, were still gonna be

Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shadeI like glitter and sparkly dresses,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la, la la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might think I'd bring up Joe,
The guy who broke up with me on the phone,
But I'm not gonna mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well,
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

And if you're wondering if I might,
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
(Hi Taylor!)
I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue.....

But there's nothing more to say
Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la
That was my SNL monologueI know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
if you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

wherever you think I am tonight 
just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye 
I'll be right where you are baby

sometime along the way you take my breath away
distracted by he view
I fall right into you

and if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

they say I need to see all the people out there waiting
but you take one look at me
and I know the mistake I'd be making

cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say between now and foreverSomething about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

It's my turn to be meOn a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing though a valley
Tearing up a good July

I'm going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good July

Going back to Nashville

I'm going back to Nashville

Going back to Naaaaahh....

Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My worlds a little colder now
But Im keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street

You need me now
Thats what youve been telling my friends
That Ive come too far to go back there again

My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
So whos gonna hold you
I dont need you now
And I dont know where you are
I dont wonder where you are
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now

I dont dream about the way
That I never heard you say
I need you I need you
I dont need you now

Dont need you
Dont need you nowI think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fadeLook at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mindIt wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skinStanding on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everythingOh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin'
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were callin my name 
When your face faded from view

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doin' nothin'
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?

Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night 
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, ohI know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'cause I'm not trying to show maturity

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

In permanent marker

Oh, permanent markerI could've keyed your car
I could've rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your emails, everything you do
I could've put 'em to good use

But I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date
With your best friend, he always liked me anyway

Baby, baby R-E-V-E-N-G-E
Gonna give you what you gave to meI was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrongI remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and backI remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)
La La (La La)
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light,
You and I'll be safe and sound...

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh oh ohLet's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still throught
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleamin
As my eyes went wild
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nightsDays go by, I wonder if you here me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing 
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is youLet me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.
I was gonna be everything you need
'Cause you're everything to me

So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skinTire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times

I remember.........

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was,
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while,
And I still think about back when.."

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeahHit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction

I'll be one of the many saying,
"Look at you now, look at you now, now."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"Look at you now, look at you now, now."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."

And when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fictionIt was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes how to know to look right through me
It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

Take time to realize I know
That people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say
To my face
But you run away

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
Yeah Yeah

Tell me what did I do
Because baby suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
And tell me

Ooooh Yeah
Tell me
Tell MeYou were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six packIm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah whats the word on you
Lay low Im a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Im poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
Im a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I dont get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Its raining on Sunday
Theres nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
Youre the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I cant stop thinking about you
I bet youre thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of meShould have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear john, 
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus:]
There's your trouble, 
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you, 
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking, 
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, 
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

[Repeat chorus]

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Repeat chorus]Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that dont offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if theyre half as stubborn as me
Theyll just keep on shining bright
I aint ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling aint strong
Ill just move on
And leave this in my past

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill act today
Until you find somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still dont know
Oh and it troubles me so

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
And Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smileWalking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

Were you a present from a father to a son
Did he forget you 
Or just play you 'til you came undone
Hey did some prima donna love you 
'Til she got her fame and fortune
I won't do that to you

Nice to meet you, I can teach you
All I know, you can show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
And I played you for endless hours
Never left you in the corner
You're my one and only friend
Now I know where life lessons are
This here guitar

You're my guitar

This here guitarBeneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
Its like Im melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
and

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still cant take my eyes off you

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh Baby,Here we are

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
Oh,This is really happening
Oh,Oh,Baby

Tell me
Youll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh,that this is really happening

Tell me,Oh
Youll always need me
(need me,tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening[T-Pain:]
Hey Hey, T-Swizzle {T-Swizzle}

[Taylor Swift:]
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
I had a dream last night

[Taylor Swift:]
I had high top Nikes
I had

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
Diamonds in my mouth 
And Diamonds on my mic

[Taylor Swift:]
By the time I woke I was singing

[T-Pain:]
I'm on a boat, whoa oh

[Taylor Swift (T-Pain):]
What, What, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, What, Don't test me (Beep)
Hey, Hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything I- (What?)
I said Yo (yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear (She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you

When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes alongToday was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Yeah yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Instrumental]

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh

Today was a fairytaleAre you trying to make me fall
'Cause with a face like that baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up 
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me 
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Na na na na na na na na na 
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh.. 

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my headI used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the worldIf you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look nowWe used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We Were Happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy

Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happyI got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy 
When I let too much go
Loves a little messy and you are too
Right now Im scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray 
Swore Id never let a man in my way

Youre the last thing I needed today

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee 
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Cant talk to my friends 
Without you coming up
Its even kind of cute 
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down 
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good 
Right next to mine

Youre the last thing I needed tonight

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

Im acting like a girl 
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring 
About anything but you

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh ohWhat do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know its real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say?
What do you say?

What do you say?
What do you say?She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it

Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life

First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again

Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

Ohh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wearYou walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words i wrote down on a page,
When i was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues,
I tell them, "this is what I do"
And its what i put my life into,
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games

So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always beenI can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind 
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do

I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do, 
I'll keep writing songs about youI bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

[Chorus:]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want...
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

[Chorus]

It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
but for someone like you it's just so easy to do

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need

If that's what you need

[Chorus]I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And i know that if i turn around you won't be there
If i close my eyes will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And i hope it never falls
And i hope i never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now i wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish i could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And i had you

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

----- tim mcgraw -----

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie."
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie.

----- picture to burn -----

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
[Album version line:] That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
[Music video version line:] That's fine you won't mind if I say
By the way...

[Chorus:]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn!

There's no time for tears,
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]

And if you're missing me,
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard,
I really really hate that...

[Chorus]

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

----- teardrops on my guitar -----

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,
And she's got everything that I have to live without.

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny [radio version]
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny [CD version]
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus:]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]

So I drive home alone.
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight.

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into.

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.

----- a place in this world -----

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus:]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's ok

[Chorus]

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,
Oh I'm just a girl

----- cold as you -----

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus:]

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Repeat Chorus]

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

----- the outside -----

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus:]

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

[Repeat Chorus]

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

----- tied together with a smile -----

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, cause I know you...

[Chorus:]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go... and no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay
Not his price to pay...

[Chorus x2]

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone... oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby

----- stay beautiful -----

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

[Chorus:]
You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey, by the way...

[Chorus]

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold,
At least you'll know...

You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for,
I hope your life lead you back to my front door.
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na

----- should've said no -----

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

[Chorus:]
You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, with what you did with her,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

[Chorus]

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this:
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No... no, no, no...

----- mary's song -----

[Chorus]She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I...
Oh my my my my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my...

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my...

----- our song -----

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

[Chorus:]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah.

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

----- i'm only me when i'm with you -----

Friday night beneath the stars,
in a field behind your yard,
you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.
And sometimes we don't say a thing;
just listen to the crickets sing.
Everything I need is right here by my side.
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you.

[Chorus:]
I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me when I'm with you.

Just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world.
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.
And I don't try to hide my tears.
The secrets or my deepest fears.
Through it all nobody gets me like you do.
And you know everything about me.
You say that you can't live without me.

[Chorus]

When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
Only you can tell.

[Chorus:]
That I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Uh huh
Yeah

----- invisible -----

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.
Shell never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by.

And you cant see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me.

[Chorus:]
I just wanna show you
She dont even know you,
She's never gonna love you like I want to.
And you just see right through me.
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

Theres a fire inside of you
That cant help but shine through.
Shes never gonna see the light
No matter what you do.

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, were invisible.
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize.

I just wanna show you
She dont even know you.
Baby, let me love you,
Let me want you.
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.

----- a perfectly good heart ----- 

[Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away.
It don't make sense to me, but:

[Repeat Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore.
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus 2:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

[Repeat Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

----- jump than fall -----

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me
Cause Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
And people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please,
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all

And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
You can Jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

----- untouchable -----

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway
But you're untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

Oh, In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

Oh, oh I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh oh

Oh, Oh, In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

Like a million little stars, spelling out your name
Spelling out your name

----- forever and always -----

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

----- come in with the rain -----

I could go back to every laugh,
But I don't wanna' go there anymore,
And I know all the steps up to your door,
But I don't wanna' go there anymore.

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky,
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find.

Ill leave my window open,
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name.
Just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

I could stand up and sing you a song,
But I dont wanna have to go that far.
And I, Ive got you down,
I know you by heart,
And you dont even know where I start.

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears,
Talk to the man who put you here,
And dont wait for the sky to clear.

Ill leave my window open,
Cus Im too tired at night to call your name.
Oh, just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

Ive watched you so long,
Screamed your name,
I dont know what else I can say.

But Ill leave my window open,
Cus Im too tired at night for all these games.
Just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

I could go back to every laugh,
But I dont wanna go there anymore

----- superstar -----

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar

----- the other side of the door -----

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again.
I mean it, I mean it."
What I mean is...

I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

----- fearless -----

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss,
It's flawless,
Really something,
It's fearless.

Oh yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Oh-oh
Oh yeah

----- fifteen -----

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
"You know I haven't seen you around before."

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.

----- love story -----

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello, "
Little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.

'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me,
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Oh, oh, oh.

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

----- hey stephen -----

Hey Stephen,
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you.
And as we walked
We were talking 
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Hey Stephen,
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Hey Stephen,
I've been holding back this feeling.
So I've got some things to say to you, ha.
I seen it all 
So I thought 
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name 
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Hey Stephen,
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.

[Chorus]

They're dimming the street lights.
You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.

Hey Stephen,
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose.
All those other girls 
Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus:]
I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself...
...if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Myself,
Can't help myself,
I can't help myself.

----- white horse -----

Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known

[Chorus:]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

[Chorus:]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
They're in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now

----- you belong with me -----

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.

But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
"Hey, isn't this easy?"

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

You belong with me.

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me.

----- breath -----

I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.

Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.

Ohhh

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

I'm sorry (oh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry

----- tell me why -----

I took a chance, I took a shot 
And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not 
You took a swing, I took it hard 
And down here from the ground I see who you are 

I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
I'm feeling like I don't know you 
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you're around 
And here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why.. 

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day 
Well I get so confused and frustrated 
Forget what i'm trying to say, oh 

I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
I got no one to believe in 
You tell me that you want me, then push me around 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you're around 
Here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why.. 

Why..do you have to make me feel small 
So you can feel whole inside 
Why..do you have to put down my dreams 
So you're the only thing on my mind 

I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
I'm feeling like I don't know you 
You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
I've got no one to believe in 
You ask me for my love then you push me around 
Here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why 
Why, tell me why 

I take a step back, let you go 
I told you i'm not bulletproof 
Now you know

----- you're not sorry -----

All this time I was wasting,
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no oh

Looking so innocent,
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no, oh

You're not sorry no no oh

You had me crying for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no oh

You're not sorry, no no oh

----- the way i loved you -----

He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and it's like 
I couldn't ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
He's close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
He's charming and endearing 
And I'm comfortable 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He can't see the smile I'm faking 
And my heart's not breaking 
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now 

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
I'm so in love that I acted insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you

----- forever and always (piano version) -----

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night,
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me?
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
I don't think so

Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
You said forever and always... yeah

----- the best day -----

I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now -- the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and window-shop
Until I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
Now at school
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today

----- change -----

And its a sad picture,
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know its all the same,
Another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah

So weve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Were getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But were faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
This revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

----- you all over me -----

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath reminds me of you

You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been reminds me of me

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your: Don't you wish you had me grin
But I did, so I smiled and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

And I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me

----- mr perfectly fine -----

Mr. Perfect face
Mr. Here to stay
Mr. Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I've been waiting for you all my life
Mr. Every single day until the end, I will be by your side

But that was when I got to know Mr. Change of heart
Mr. Leaves me all alone, I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello, Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

Hello, Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine

Mr. Never told me why
Mr. Never had to see me cry
Mr. Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy

He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest
I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm around a brand new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

Hello, Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

Hello, Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine

So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room

Oh, he's so smug, Mr. Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then you'll be Mr. Too Late

Goodbye, Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

Goodbye, Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine
You're perfectly fine

Mr. Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
You said you'd never go away

----- we were happy -----

We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy

We were happy
Oh, oh, oh
We were happy

----- that's when -----

You said: I know
When I said: I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
You watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said: When can I, I, I come back?

And you said: That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Hmm, hmm

I said: I know
When you said: I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said: Leave those all in our past
And you said: When can I, I, I come back?

And I said: That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when

And you say: Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?
And I said

That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing, when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when

----- don't' you -----

Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just something I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say: We're still friends
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again

Don't you (don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (don't you) say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (you don't) know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you, ah, ah, ah

----- bye bye baby -----

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

----- mine -----

Uh, oh, oh
Uh, oh, oh

You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As were lying on the couch
The moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Flash forward and were taking on the world together,
And theres a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded,
You say well never make my parents mistakes.

But we got bills to pay,
We got nothing figured out,
When it was hard to take,
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the "Goodbye."
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "Ill never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, its like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.
She is the best thing thats ever been mine."

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

(Hold on) do you believe it?
(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
(Hold on) and I can see it,
(Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)

----- sparks fly -----

The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something,
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

Drop everything now,
Meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk,
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
And the sparks fly...

----- back to december -----

I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier than ever,
We small talk, work and the weather,
Your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
Realized I loved you in the fall.

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time.

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry.

Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
So if the chain is on your door I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time.
All the time.

----- speak now -----

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus:]
Dont say "Yes", run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me,
Dont you?

[Chorus:]
Dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
Dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
Theres the silence, theres my last chance.
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only looking at you.

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus:]
So, dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Lets run away now,
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door.
Baby, I didnt say my vows,
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."

----- dear john -----

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through, again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home, I should've known.

Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so, I should've known.

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you've burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shouldve known.

You shouldve known
Dont you think I was too young?
You shouldve known.

----- mean -----

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well you can take me down with just one single blow
But you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so?...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

----- the story of us -----

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
How we met and the sparks flew instantly,
and people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.

Oh, a simple complication,
Miscommunications lead to fall-out.
So many things that I wish you knew,
So many walls up I can't break through.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

Next chapter.

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
And you're doing your best to avoid me.
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
But you held your pride like you should've held me.

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,
I've never heard silence quite this loud.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

This is looking like a contest,
Of who can act like they care less,
But I liked it better when you were on my side.
The battle's in your hands now,
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight.
So many things that you wish I knew,
But the story of us might be ending soon.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.
And we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

The end.

----- never grow up -----

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

----- enchanted -----

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity,
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey,
It was enchanting to meet you,
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

----- better than revenge -----

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did"

Ha!
Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
Come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

----- innocent -----

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been.
You're still an innocent,
You're still an innocent.

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did.
You're still an innocent.

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent.
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent.
You're still an innocent.

Lost your balance on a tightrope.
It's never too late to get it back.

----- haunted -----

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No.

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it...

----- last kiss -----

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last...

----- logn live -----

I said remember this moment in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment, promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

----- ours -----

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

----- if this was a movie -----

Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me,
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
Not before I knew how much I had to lose."

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there,
If you're somewhere,
If you're moving on,
I've been waiting for you.
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before.
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said, "It's not that easy."
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now

----- superman -----

Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you? "
I say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around...
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

When you come back down

----- state of grace -----

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

----- red -----

[Verse 1:]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2:]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge:]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus:]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Post-Chorus:]
And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

----- treacherous -----

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away,
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow,
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

----- i knew you were trouble -----

[Music video spoken part:]
I think--I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Music video spoken part:]
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.

----- all too well -----

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow.
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer even now.

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

And I know it's long gone,
And that magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay,
But I'm not fine at all.

'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to...

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

----- 22 -----

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Uh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Uh oh! (hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news.
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news,
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

----- i almost do -----

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess, babe,
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.

----- we are never ever getting back together -----

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space. (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together,
We are never ever ever getting back together,
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever...

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never..."
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"

No!

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
We, ooh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

----- stay, stay, stay -----

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
I threw my phone across the room at you.
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
But you stayed.

This morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
Who took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.

You took the time to memorize me:
My fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' out with you all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave;
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.

Stay.
And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

[Background:] That's so fun!

----- the last time -----

[Gary Lightbody:]
I find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,
I'm not sure how I got there,
All roadsthey lead me here.

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better,

[Both:]
and right before your eyes,
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why,
Just you and me.

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[Taylor Swift:]
You find yourself at my door,
Just like all those times before,
You wear your best apology,
But I was there to watch you leave,

And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better.

[Both:]
and right before your eyes,
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide,
Just you and me...

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...

[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time I let you in my door,
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.

Oh, oh, oh,

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye.

[4x:]
This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this...

----- holy ground -----

I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light "Go".
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made,
And that was the first day.

And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you,
And for the first time I had something to lose,
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
And the storys got dust on every page,
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
And I see your face in every crowd.

Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you,

It was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.

----- sad beautiful tragic -----

Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had  a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

----- the lucky one -----

New to town with a made up name in the angel's city,
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.

You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixties queen.

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...

Now its big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

And they tell you that youre lucky.
But youre so confused,
'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive.

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now.

Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

Yeah theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

----- everything was changed -----

[Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Ed Sheeran]
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

[Taylor Swift (Album version) / Ed Sheeran (Remix version):]
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
[Album version:] Taking flight, making me feel right
[Remix version:] Taking flight, making me feel right like

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Bridge]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind.

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
All I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello."
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

----- starlight -----

I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window,
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

----- begin again -----

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

----- the moment i knew -----

You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there's one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you",
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.
Ooh,

You called me later,
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew.

----- come back... be here -----

You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached,"
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can't put this down,
If I had known what I'd known now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in London today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you when you are worlds away.

New York... be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here.
Come back... be here.

----- girl at home -----

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that.

I don't even know her,
But I feel a responsibility,
To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

So don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you've got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And tell her you're coming home,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

It would be a fine proposition,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

----- welcome to new york -----

Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud
Heartbeats under coats
Everybody here
Wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't
Heard before
And it said

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on
Apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else
Before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and
Girls and girls

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love it keeps you
Guessing
Like any real love
It's ever changing
Like any true love

It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't
Change anything anything
Anything

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright
They never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

----- blank space -----

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

----- style -----

Midnight,
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive,
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style.

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I...
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah.
Just take me home
(out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

----- out of the woods -----

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus 2x:]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance,
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

[Chorus 2x]

(Are we out of the woods?!)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me,
I remember, oh, I remember

----- all you had to do was stay -----

[Chorus 4x]People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Let me remind
You this was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

----- shake it off -----

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates [chuckle]
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Yeah ohhh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

----- i wish you would -----

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room.
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would

----- bad blood -----

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
Mhmmm
If you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
(Hey)

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

----- wildest dreams -----

He said, "Let's get out of this town,
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
I thought heaven can't help me now.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.

I said, "No one has to know what we do, "
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.

----- how you get the girl -----

Oh oh oh.
Oh-oh.

Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane ('ane)?"
Say it's been a long 6 months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want.

And that's how it works.
That's how you get the girl.
And then you say,

"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I would wait forever and ever."

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...

Remind her how it used to be (yeah, yeah)
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks)
Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh)
When you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).

And that's how it works.
That's how you lost the girl.
And now you say,

"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever),
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)."

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah)

And you could know (oh-oh oh oh)
That I don't want you to go oh-oh..

Remind me how it used to be.
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
And say you want me.
Yeah...

And then you say,

"I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better),
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I want you forever and ever."

[4x]
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl.
Oh.

That's how it works.
That's how you got the girl.

----- this love -----

Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams,
in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you're still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip,
oh, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]

Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... 

----- i know places -----

You stand with your hand on my waist line
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out 

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time 

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places 

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places

----- clean -----

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean

10 months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Think I'm finally clean

----- wonderland -----

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole.

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control.

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night.

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed.

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams.

Oh

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.

But darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

----- you are in love -----

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burn toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says
You're my best friend
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

----- new romantics -----

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded,
It's so romantic

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

----- ready for it? -----

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holding him for ransom, some
Some boys are trying too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor (hey!)
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure (hey)
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I-I-I see how this is gon' go (go)
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low (low)
No one has to know
(No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Ooh
Are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (in my dreams)
You should see the things we do,(we do) baby,(baby) hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time

In the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

----- end game -----

[Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation (git, git)
Ah, and I heard about you
Ooh, You like the bad ones, too (yeah)

[Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (yeah)
I'm in a G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it, too 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down, and I protect you with my life (my life)

[Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee-deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you, I don't wanna miss you
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Aah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (hey!)
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Aah, and I heard about you
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too

[Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang! We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Taylor Swift, Future & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (me and you) (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now) (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (oh, I do!) (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

----- i did something bad -----

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look, oh so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly him all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it coming what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says: Don't throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name then I owe him nothing
And if he spends my change then he had it coming

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up, light me up, light me up
Go ahead and light me up
Light me up, light me up, light me up, light me up

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good? (so good)
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, (good) good

Oh, you say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good?
It just felt so good, good

----- don't blame me -----

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh-whoah-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

[Outro]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

----- delicate -----

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
('Cause I like you)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
('Cause I like you)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?

----- look what you made me do -----

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me—)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

----- so it goes -----

[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

[Bridge]
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting? (One, two, three)

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place (Pieces fall)
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
I do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

----- gorgeous -----

[Intro]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous

----- getaway car -----

[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We’re both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

----- king of my heart -----

[Verse 1]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "Baby" like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once
[Verse 2]
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once
[Bridge]
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

----- dancing with our hands tied -----

[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

[Chorus]
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)

----- dress -----

[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about—
[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha...

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops...
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Outro]
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

----- this is why we can't have nice things -----

[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

----- call it what you want -----

[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want... to

----- new year's day -----

[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

----- i forgot that you existed -----

[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show
[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah

----- cruel summer -----

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil
[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

----- lover -----

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

----- the man -----

[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I’d be the man
I'd be the man

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)
[Outro]
If I was a man, then I'd be the man

----- the archer -----

[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay
[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat

----- i think he knows -----

[Verse 1]
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)
[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

[Bridge]
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows
[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows

----- miss americana and the heart break prince -----

[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know

[Outro]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"

----- paper rings -----

[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Outro]
You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

----- cornelia street -----

[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

[Outro]
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

----- death by a thousand cuts -----

[Intro]
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?
[Chorus]
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

----- london boy -----

[Intro: Idris Elba & James Corden]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)
[Outro]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

----- soon you'll get better -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
[Bridge: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

----- false god -----

[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah
[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

----- you need to calm down -----

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

----- afterglow -----

[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

----- me -----

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like
[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

----- it's nice to have a friend -----

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

----- daylight -----

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)
[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

----- the 1 -----

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

----- cardigan -----

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

----- the last great american diynasty -----

[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time

----- exile -----

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

----- my tears ricochet -----

[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

----- mirrorball -----

[Verse 1]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

----- seven -----

[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Bridge]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
[Verse 2]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long

----- august -----

[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

----- this is me trying -----

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying

----- illicit affairs -----

[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times

----- invisible string -----

[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)

------ mad woman -----

[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that

----- epiphany -----

[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)
[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

----- betty -----

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

----- peace -----

[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

----- hoax -----

[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

----- willow -----

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

----- ​champagne problems -----

[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

----- ​gold rush -----

[Intro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

[Outro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

----- ​'tis the damn season -----

[Verse 1]
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Outro]
It always leads to you and my hometown

----- ​tolerate it -----

[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
[Bridge]
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

[Chorus 2]
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Outro]
I sit and watch you

----- ​no body, no crime -----

[Intro: HAIM]
He did it
He did it

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

[Outro: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died

----- happiness -----

[Verse 1]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

----- dorothea -----

[Verse 1]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

[Chorus]
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything

[Verse 2]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show

[Chorus]
But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah

----- ​coney island -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold

----- ivy -----

[Verse 1]
How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours
[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you
[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you
In you

----- cowboy like me -----

[Verse 1]
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Chorus]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Verse 3]
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

[Chorus]
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me

[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Chorus]
You're a cowboy like me

[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Bridge]
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

[Verse 4]
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

[Chorus]
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
[Outro]
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again

----- long story short -----

[Verse 1]
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready
[Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Bridge]
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

[Verse 3]
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you
(And now) Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Outro]
Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived

----- marjorie -----

[Verse 1]
Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Verse 2]
Never be so politе
You forget your power
Nevеr wield such power
You forget to be polite
[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Bridge]
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me
[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Outro]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around

----- closure -----

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure

[Verse 2]
Don't treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears, and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing bettеr
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your lеtter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure
Your closure, your closure
[Bridge]
I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, closure, your closure
Your closure

----- evermore -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

[Bridge 1: Justin Vernon]
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

[Bridge 2: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore

----- more -----

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

wahooahoo

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not cause were just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on youtube

Cause, Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancingI wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy, 
Thinking about him

I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]

There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be

[Chorus]

I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right nowSometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveAmerican boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the dream of an american boy

American boy, raising little babies
hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
that's grown up, american boy

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
the hope of an american boyWell, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girlAngelinas got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
Ive never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I dont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
Hes got everything youd wanna be
Hes funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I wont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But aint it funny how
It all comes out
Isnt life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say

I have always been a bit reckless

And Im not, Im not oh

I wasnt brought up that wayI like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean,
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you say,

When you say our love could last forever

Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

Oh, yeah, yeah

You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge - Taylor Swift (Kendrick Lamar):]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
(Think we can solve 'em!)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
(Look what you've done)
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes

I don't know why
i want to be somewhere where you are

[Chorus:]
You're here, You're eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your

In only a little while... I'll cry
Cause you're my lullaby
SO baby come hold me tight cause I-I

[Chorus]

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyesAll is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my babyHer hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
Hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you, she'll unease you
Just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you when she snows you
She knows you, she's got Bette Davis EyesI live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

All my friends are saying 
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, 
you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone

All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know betterHere you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
BreathlessEmily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."

She said, "I wish there was some way
To make them stop it."
So he drives down to
That principles office and says,

"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down.
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out.
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile.
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
And he said,

"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down.
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out.
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile.
So don't let nobody take that away.
You weren't brought up that way."

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's officer Tate."
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident.
You better come down here right away.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
And Emily  she's fading fast."

He says, "God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down.
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground.
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile.
So please don't take that away.
It won't be easy taking her today.
She wasn't brought up that way."

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyesI had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say 
I'm looking good

But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number; just in case
I still miss you
And i still love you
By the way
By the way, ohAny day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well thats good enough for me
Dont need the real thing
Thats just another thing 
For me to try to tame
Dont know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

Before I met him 
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But Ill never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see meI'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus:]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus]

Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier.Ive been counting days and
Ive been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
Ive been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
Cause Ive been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if youve seen one
Id like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonightHe said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue TennesseeShe walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you?
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

He kissed his wife good bye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said,
"We're here to die for our God."
He stood up and said, "That's funny,
'Cause my God died for me."

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you?
And didn't he pray too?

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down

And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you? Where were you?
And didn't they pray too?

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every dayMy momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew 
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eyeHere in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me 
When we started home it started to rain 
You put your coat around me 
We stood there in the road 
You held me so close 
But did you ever let go 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
The bitter sting of what we couldve been 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

In through the window I see her with you 
Im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry 
I guess the storm is over for you 
But look at the tears here in my eyes 
I just stood there like a ghost 
As you held her so close 
And as I let you go 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Love like this changes who you are 
Every kiss you gave me is a scar 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

All I need is to move on fast 
But all I want is to have you back 
And it just keeps falling 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
The bitter sting of what we couldve been 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

Down came the rain[Spoken:] You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey 

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated 

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.

Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

(Keep your eyes open [4x])

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes openIsn't it funny how many times we can say,
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car,
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh,

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me,
Fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on youSomeone struck a match against the night,
All I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.

For a while I thought that I could hold you,
But you were just a temporary high. 

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free,
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand,
I tried to catch you, but I can't 
Chase the wind

And just as I reach out to touch you,
I remind myself you were meant to fly.

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you,  firefly
FireflyMy name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kinda scared 'cause
I never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
And she says that

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
An' I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
But none of us want to get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we doWish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something i just fell into, 

And it was over-rated
But just look what i've created
I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue

Before you ask me if i'm alright, 
Think about what i, 
Had to do-oo, yeah

Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess i didn't plan, 
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me, 
Wish you could only see, 
I've got an i heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand.

I'd be fine if you just walked by, 
But you had to talk about why, 
You were wrong and i was right, 

But i can't believe you made me, 
Sit at home and cry like a baby, 
Wait right by the phone every night, 

And now you ask about you and i, 
There's no you and i, 
Remember what you put me through, 
I had to, 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Fix my heart put on my make-up, 
Another mess i didn't plan, 
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an i heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand 

And when you're home alone at night, 
You'll still wonder 
Why you took everything i had, oh baby
I had a lot about you and i, 
There's no you and i, 
And i know, 
Someday you will...

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planed, 

And you'll know you didn't beat me, 
When you look down and see, 
I've got an i heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand, 

Written on the back of my hand
An i heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand[Taylor Swift:]
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] I told you I was, I was) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

[Sammy Adams:]
Double platinum wherever she go
South of France to Reno
Met her out in Vegas
Went in on casino 
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad, bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate...just yet
Slow down, I know that 
You thinking you and me...just met 
But girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy

Some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
And ya feel the same way, same way 
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man 
I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn
And I can care less that your famous
We can make the perfect couple
Cause my first name big, last name trouble
Yeah

[Taylor Swift:]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, troubleI like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream

I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see

Dont try me
Dont fight me
You be you and Ill be me

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you

Your mum and daddys walls
Are covered up in pictures of you

You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into

So sorry, dont worry
Im sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you
And it aint you oh

Oh baby, dont persuade me
I know that you aint used to no
So let me say it real slow

They say Ive always known
What I wanted, its true
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I get what I want

And they say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
And youll will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint youI... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the skyThrowing pennies at the fountain, 
When you're standing on a mountain, 
It's kinda hard to aim. 

But like the trees we cut our names in, 
There must be an explanation, 
Guess it didn't given off rain. 
I need reasons why you're leaving 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
I thought was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really from your heart 
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought was a star. 

Diving off into the deep end, 
Honestly believe you'd be there, 
When I jumped in, 
Is ain't your territory, 
We had the perfect love story, 
except ending. 
Nothing comes true, 
When it comes to you. 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really from your heart 
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star. 

And I was too cloudy, 
It's not my fault I just couldn't see. 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
I thought it was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star. 

Throwing pennies at the fountain, 
When you're standing on a mountain, 
It's kinda hard to aim.I dont think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
Hell never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs
And...

[Chorus:]
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
Id lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldnt a light go on?
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine

[Chorus]

He stands there, then walks away
My god if I could only say,
"Im holding every breath for you..."

Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is "My god, hes beautiful."
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
Id lieShe didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing whyI got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ohCome on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went outThere's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you

Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you ain't so far away

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky youYour feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

Do you know when you go 
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Made Up You

Oh oh

Made Up YouHe's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine

People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolinMe and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
Or where else to go

Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

Oh, oh
Were not as young, but were still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when were old, were still gonna be

Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shadeI like glitter and sparkly dresses,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la, la la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might think I'd bring up Joe,
The guy who broke up with me on the phone,
But I'm not gonna mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well,
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

And if you're wondering if I might,
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
(Hi Taylor!)
I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue.....

But there's nothing more to say
Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la
That was my SNL monologueI know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
if you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

wherever you think I am tonight 
just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye 
I'll be right where you are baby

sometime along the way you take my breath away
distracted by he view
I fall right into you

and if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

they say I need to see all the people out there waiting
but you take one look at me
and I know the mistake I'd be making

cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say between now and foreverSomething about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

It's my turn to be meOn a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing though a valley
Tearing up a good July

I'm going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good July

Going back to Nashville

I'm going back to Nashville

Going back to Naaaaahh....

Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My worlds a little colder now
But Im keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street

You need me now
Thats what youve been telling my friends
That Ive come too far to go back there again

My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
So whos gonna hold you
I dont need you now
And I dont know where you are
I dont wonder where you are
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now

I dont dream about the way
That I never heard you say
I need you I need you
I dont need you now

Dont need you
Dont need you nowI think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fadeLook at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mindIt wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skinStanding on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everythingOh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin'
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were callin my name 
When your face faded from view

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doin' nothin'
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?

Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night 
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, ohI know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'cause I'm not trying to show maturity

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

In permanent marker

Oh, permanent markerI could've keyed your car

I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrongI remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and backI remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)
La La (La La)
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light,
You and I'll be safe and sound...

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh oh ohLet's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still throught
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleamin
As my eyes went wild
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nightsDays go by, I wonder if you here me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing 
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is youLet me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.
I was gonna be everything you need
'Cause you're everything to me

So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skinTire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times

I remember.........

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was,
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while,
And I still think about back when.."

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeahHit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction

I'll be one of the many saying,
"Look at you now, look at you now, now."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"Look at you now, look at you now, now."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."

And when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fictionIt was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes how to know to look right through me
It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

Take time to realize I know
That people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say
To my face
But you run away

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
Yeah Yeah

Tell me what did I do
Because baby suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
And tell me

Ooooh Yeah
Tell me
Tell MeYou were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six packIm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah whats the word on you
Lay low Im a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Im poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
Im a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I dont get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Its raining on Sunday
Theres nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
Youre the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I cant stop thinking about you
I bet youre thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of meShould have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear john, 
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus:]
There's your trouble, 
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you, 
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking, 
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, 
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

[Repeat chorus]

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Repeat chorus]Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that dont offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if theyre half as stubborn as me
Theyll just keep on shining bright
I aint ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling aint strong
Ill just move on
And leave this in my past

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill act today
Until you find somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still dont know
Oh and it troubles me so

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
And Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smileWalking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

Were you a present from a father to a son
Did he forget you 
Or just play you 'til you came undone
Hey did some prima donna love you 
'Til she got her fame and fortune
I won't do that to you

Nice to meet you, I can teach you
All I know, you can show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
And I played you for endless hours
Never left you in the corner
You're my one and only friend
Now I know where life lessons are
This here guitar

You're my guitar

This here guitarBeneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
Its like Im melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
and

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still cant take my eyes off you

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh Baby,Here we are

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
Oh,This is really happening
Oh,Oh,Baby

Tell me
Youll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh,that this is really happening

Tell me,Oh
Youll always need me
(need me,tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening[T-Pain:]
Hey Hey, T-Swizzle {T-Swizzle}
And T-Pizzle {T-Pizzle}

[Taylor Swift:]
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
I had a dream last night

[Taylor Swift:]
I had high top Nikes
I had

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
Diamonds in my mouth 
And Diamonds on my mic

[Taylor Swift:]
By the time I woke I was singing

[T-Pain:]
I'm on a boat, whoa oh

[Taylor Swift:]

[Taylor Swift (T-Pain):]
What, What, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, What, Don't test me (Beep)
Hey, Hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything I- (What?)
I said Yo (yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear (She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you

When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes alongToday was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Yeah yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Instrumental]

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh

Today was a fairytaleAre you trying to make me fall
'Cause with a face like that baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up 
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me 
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Na na na na na na na na na 
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh.. 

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my headI used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the worldIf you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look nowWe used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We Were Happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy

Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happyI got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy 
When I let too much go
Loves a little messy and you are too
Right now Im scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray 
Swore Id never let a man in my way

Youre the last thing I needed today

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee 
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Cant talk to my friends 
Without you coming up
Its even kind of cute 
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down 
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good 
Right next to mine

Youre the last thing I needed tonight

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

Im acting like a girl 
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring 
About anything but you

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh ohWhat do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know its real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say?
What do you say?

What do you say?
What do you say?She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it

Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life

First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again

Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

Ohh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wearYou walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words i wrote down on a page,
When i was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues,
I tell them, "this is what I do"
And its what i put my life into,
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games

So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always beenI can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind 
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do

I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do, 
I'll keep writing songs about youI bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

[Chorus:]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want...
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

[Chorus]

It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
but for someone like you it's just so easy to do

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need

If that's what you need

[Chorus]I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And i know that if i turn around you won't be there
If i close my eyes will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And i hope it never falls
And i hope i never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now i wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish i could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And i had you

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

----- tim mcgraw -----

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie."
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie.

----- picture to burn -----

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
[Album version line:] That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
[Music video version line:] That's fine you won't mind if I say
By the way...

[Chorus:]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn!

There's no time for tears,
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]

And if you're missing me,
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard,
I really really hate that...

[Chorus]

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

----- teardrops on my guitar -----

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,
And she's got everything that I have to live without.

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny [radio version]
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny [CD version]
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus:]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]

So I drive home alone.
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight.

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into.

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.

----- a place in this world -----

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus:]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's ok

[Chorus]

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,
Oh I'm just a girl

----- cold as you -----

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus:]

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Repeat Chorus]

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

----- the outside -----

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus:]

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

[Repeat Chorus]

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

----- tied together with a smile -----

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, cause I know you...

[Chorus:]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go... and no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay
Not his price to pay...

[Chorus x2]

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone... oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby

----- stay beautiful -----

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

[Chorus:]
You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey, by the way...

[Chorus]

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold,
At least you'll know...

You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for,
I hope your life lead you back to my front door.
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na

----- should've said no -----

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

[Chorus:]
You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, with what you did with her,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

[Chorus]

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this:
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No... no, no, no...

----- mary's song -----

[Chorus]She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I...
Oh my my my my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my...

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my...

----- our song -----

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

[Chorus:]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah.

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

----- i'm only me when i'm with you -----

Friday night beneath the stars,
in a field behind your yard,
you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.
And sometimes we don't say a thing;
just listen to the crickets sing.
Everything I need is right here by my side.
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you.

[Chorus:]
I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me when I'm with you.

Just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world.
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.
And I don't try to hide my tears.
The secrets or my deepest fears.
Through it all nobody gets me like you do.
And you know everything about me.
You say that you can't live without me.

[Chorus]

When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
Only you can tell.

[Chorus:]
That I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Uh huh
Yeah

----- invisible -----

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.
Shell never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by.

And you cant see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me.

[Chorus:]
I just wanna show you
She dont even know you,
She's never gonna love you like I want to.
And you just see right through me.
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

Theres a fire inside of you
That cant help but shine through.
Shes never gonna see the light
No matter what you do.

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, were invisible.
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize.

I just wanna show you
She dont even know you.
Baby, let me love you,
Let me want you.
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.

----- a perfectly good heart ----- 

[Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away.
It don't make sense to me, but:

[Repeat Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore.
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus 2:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

[Repeat Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

----- jump than fall -----

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me
Cause Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
And people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please,
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Be there, never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby,
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
You can Jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

----- untouchable -----

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway
But you're untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

Oh, In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

Oh, oh I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh oh

Oh, Oh, In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

Like a million little stars, spelling out your name
Spelling out your name

----- forever and always -----

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

----- come in with the rain -----

I could go back to every laugh,
But I don't wanna' go there anymore,
And I know all the steps up to your door,
But I don't wanna' go there anymore.

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky,
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find.

Ill leave my window open,
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name.
Just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

I could stand up and sing you a song,
But I dont wanna have to go that far.
And I, Ive got you down,
I know you by heart,
And you dont even know where I start.

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears,
Talk to the man who put you here,
And dont wait for the sky to clear.

Ill leave my window open,
Cus Im too tired at night to call your name.
Oh, just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

Ive watched you so long,
Screamed your name,
I dont know what else I can say.

But Ill leave my window open,
Cus Im too tired at night for all these games.
Just know Im right here hopin,
That youll come in with the rain.

I could go back to every laugh,
But I dont wanna go there anymore

----- superstar -----

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar

----- the other side of the door -----

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again.
I mean it, I mean it."
What I mean is...

I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

----- fearless -----

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss,
It's flawless,
Really something,
It's fearless.

Oh yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Oh-oh
Oh yeah

----- fifteen -----

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
"You know I haven't seen you around before."

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.

----- love story -----

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello, "
Little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.

'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me,
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Oh, oh, oh.

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

----- hey stephen -----

Hey Stephen,
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you.
And as we walked
We were talking 
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Hey Stephen,
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Hey Stephen,
I've been holding back this feeling.
So I've got some things to say to you, ha.
I seen it all 
So I thought 
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name 
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Hey Stephen,
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.

[Chorus]

They're dimming the street lights.
You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.

Hey Stephen,
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose.
All those other girls 
Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus:]
I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself...
...if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Myself,
Can't help myself,
I can't help myself.

----- white horse -----

Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known

[Chorus:]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

[Chorus:]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
They're in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now

----- you belong with me -----

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.

But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
"Hey, isn't this easy?"

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

You belong with me.

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me.

----- breath -----

I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.

Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.

Ohhh

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

I'm sorry (oh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry

----- tell me why -----

I took a chance, I took a shot 
And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not 
You took a swing, I took it hard 
And down here from the ground I see who you are 

I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
I'm feeling like I don't know you 
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you're around 
And here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why.. 

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day 
Well I get so confused and frustrated 
Forget what i'm trying to say, oh 

I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
I got no one to believe in 
You tell me that you want me, then push me around 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you're around 
Here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why.. 

Why..do you have to make me feel small 
So you can feel whole inside 
Why..do you have to put down my dreams 
So you're the only thing on my mind 

I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
I'm feeling like I don't know you 
You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
I've got no one to believe in 
You ask me for my love then you push me around 
Here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why 
Why, tell me why 

I take a step back, let you go 
I told you i'm not bulletproof 
Now you know

----- you're not sorry -----

All this time I was wasting,
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no oh

Looking so innocent,
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no, oh

You're not sorry no no oh

You had me crying for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no oh

You're not sorry, no no oh

----- the way i loved you -----

He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and it's like 
I couldn't ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
He's close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
He's charming and endearing 
And I'm comfortable 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He can't see the smile I'm faking 
And my heart's not breaking 
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now 

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
I'm so in love that I acted insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you

----- forever and always (piano version) -----

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night,
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me?
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
I don't think so

Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
You said forever and always... yeah

----- the best day -----

I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now -- the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and window-shop
Until I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
Now at school
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today

----- change -----

And its a sad picture,
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know its all the same,
Another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah

So weve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Were getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But were faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
This revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

----- you all over me -----

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath reminds me of you

You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been reminds me of me

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your: Don't you wish you had me grin
But I did, so I smiled and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

And I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me

----- mr perfectly fine -----

Mr. Perfect face
Mr. Here to stay
Mr. Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I've been waiting for you all my life
Mr. Every single day until the end, I will be by your side

But that was when I got to know Mr. Change of heart
Mr. Leaves me all alone, I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello, Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

Hello, Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine

Mr. Never told me why
Mr. Never had to see me cry
Mr. Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy

He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest
I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm around a brand new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

Hello, Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

Hello, Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine

So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room

Oh, he's so smug, Mr. Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then you'll be Mr. Too Late

Goodbye, Mr. Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby

Goodbye, Mr. Casually cruel
Mr. Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Mr. Perfectly fine
You're perfectly fine

Mr. Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
You said you'd never go away

----- we were happy -----

We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We were happy

When it was good, baby
It was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy

We were happy
Oh, oh, oh
We were happy

----- that's when -----

You said: I know
When I said: I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
You watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said: When can I, I, I come back?

And you said: That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Hmm, hmm

I said: I know
When you said: I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said: Leave those all in our past
And you said: When can I, I, I come back?

And I said: That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when

And you say: Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?
And I said

That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing, when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when

----- don't' you -----

Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just something I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say: We're still friends
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again

Don't you (don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (don't you) say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (you don't) know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you, ah, ah, ah

----- bye bye baby -----

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

----- mine -----

Uh, oh, oh
Uh, oh, oh

You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As were lying on the couch
The moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Flash forward and were taking on the world together,
And theres a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded,
You say well never make my parents mistakes.

But we got bills to pay,
We got nothing figured out,
When it was hard to take,
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the "Goodbye."
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "Ill never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, its like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.
She is the best thing thats ever been mine."

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.

(Hold on) do you believe it?
(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
(Hold on) and I can see it,
(Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)

----- sparks fly -----

The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something,
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

Drop everything now,
Meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk,
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
And the sparks fly...

----- back to december -----

I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier than ever,
We small talk, work and the weather,
Your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
Realized I loved you in the fall.

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time.

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry.

Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
So if the chain is on your door I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time.
All the time.

----- speak now -----

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus:]
Dont say "Yes", run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me,
Dont you?

[Chorus:]
Dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
Dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
Theres the silence, theres my last chance.
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only looking at you.

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus:]
So, dont say "Yes", run away now,
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Lets run away now,
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door.
Baby, I didnt say my vows,
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."

----- dear john -----

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through, again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home, I should've known.

Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so, I should've known.

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you've burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shouldve known.

You shouldve known
Dont you think I was too young?
You shouldve known.

----- mean -----

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well you can take me down with just one single blow
But you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so?...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

----- the story of us -----

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
How we met and the sparks flew instantly,
and people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.

Oh, a simple complication,
Miscommunications lead to fall-out.
So many things that I wish you knew,
So many walls up I can't break through.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

Next chapter.

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
And you're doing your best to avoid me.
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
But you held your pride like you should've held me.

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,
I've never heard silence quite this loud.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

This is looking like a contest,
Of who can act like they care less,
But I liked it better when you were on my side.
The battle's in your hands now,
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight.
So many things that you wish I knew,
But the story of us might be ending soon.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.
And we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

The end.

----- never grow up -----

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

----- enchanted -----

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity,
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey,
It was enchanting to meet you,
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

----- better than revenge -----

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did"

Ha!
Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
Come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

----- innocent -----

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been.
You're still an innocent,
You're still an innocent.

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did.
You're still an innocent.

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent.
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent.
You're still an innocent.

Lost your balance on a tightrope.
It's never too late to get it back.

----- haunted -----

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No.

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it...

----- last kiss -----

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last...

----- logn live -----

I said remember this moment in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment, promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

----- ours -----

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

----- if this was a movie -----

Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me,
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
Not before I knew how much I had to lose."

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there,
If you're somewhere,
If you're moving on,
I've been waiting for you.
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before.
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said, "It's not that easy."
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now

----- superman -----

Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you? "
I say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around...
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

When you come back down

----- state of grace -----

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

----- red -----

[Verse 1:]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2:]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge:]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus:]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Post-Chorus:]
And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

----- treacherous -----

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away,
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow,
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

----- i knew you were trouble -----

[Music video spoken part:]
I think--I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Music video spoken part:]
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.

----- all too well -----

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow.
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer even now.

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

And I know it's long gone,
And that magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay,
But I'm not fine at all.

'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to...

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

----- 22 -----

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Uh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Uh oh! (hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news.
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news,
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

----- i almost do -----

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess, babe,
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.

----- we are never ever getting back together -----

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space. (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together,
We are never ever ever getting back together,
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever...

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never..."
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"

No!

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
We, ooh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

----- stay, stay, stay -----

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
I threw my phone across the room at you.
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
But you stayed.

This morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
Who took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.

You took the time to memorize me:
My fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' out with you all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave;
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.

Stay.
And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

[Background:] That's so fun!

----- the last time -----

[Gary Lightbody:]
I find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,
I'm not sure how I got there,
All roadsthey lead me here.

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better,

[Both:]
and right before your eyes,
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why,
Just you and me.

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[Taylor Swift:]
You find yourself at my door,
Just like all those times before,
You wear your best apology,
But I was there to watch you leave,

And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better.

[Both:]
and right before your eyes,
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide,
Just you and me...

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...

[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time I let you in my door,
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.

Oh, oh, oh,

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye.

[4x:]
This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this...

----- holy ground -----

I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light "Go".
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made,
And that was the first day.

And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you,
And for the first time I had something to lose,
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
And the storys got dust on every page,
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
And I see your face in every crowd.

Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you,

It was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.

----- sad beautiful tragic -----

Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had  a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

----- the lucky one -----

New to town with a made up name in the angel's city,
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.

You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixties queen.

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...

Now its big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

And they tell you that youre lucky.
But youre so confused,
'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive.

And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now.

Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

Yeah theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

----- everything was changed -----

[Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Ed Sheeran]
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

[Taylor Swift (Album version) / Ed Sheeran (Remix version):]
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
[Album version:] Taking flight, making me feel right
[Remix version:] Taking flight, making me feel right like

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Bridge]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind.

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
All I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello."
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

----- starlight -----

I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window,
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

----- begin again -----

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

----- the moment i knew -----

You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there's one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you",
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.
Ooh,

You called me later,
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew.

----- come back... be here -----

You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached,"
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can't put this down,
If I had known what I'd known now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in London today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you when you are worlds away.

New York... be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here.
Come back... be here.

----- girl at home -----

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that.

I don't even know her,
But I feel a responsibility,
To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

So don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you've got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And tell her you're coming home,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

It would be a fine proposition,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

----- welcome to new york -----

Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud
Heartbeats under coats
Everybody here
Wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't
Heard before
And it said

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on
Apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else
Before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and
Girls and girls

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love it keeps you
Guessing
Like any real love
It's ever changing
Like any true love

It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't
Change anything anything
Anything

[Chorus:]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright
They never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

----- blank space -----

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

----- style -----

Midnight,
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive,
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style.

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I...
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah.
Just take me home
(out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

----- out of the woods -----

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus 2x:]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance,
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

[Chorus 2x]

(Are we out of the woods?!)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me,
I remember, oh, I remember

----- all you had to do was stay -----

[Chorus 4x]People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Let me remind
You this was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

----- shake it off -----

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates [chuckle]
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Yeah ohhh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

----- i wish you would -----

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room.
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would

----- bad blood -----

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
Mhmmm
If you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
(Hey)

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

----- wildest dreams -----

He said, "Let's get out of this town,
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
I thought heaven can't help me now.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.

I said, "No one has to know what we do, "
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh,
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh.

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha ohh
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.

----- how you get the girl -----

Oh oh oh.
Oh-oh.

Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane ('ane)?"
Say it's been a long 6 months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want.

And that's how it works.
That's how you get the girl.
And then you say,

"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I would wait forever and ever."

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...

Remind her how it used to be (yeah, yeah)
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks)
Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh)
When you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).

And that's how it works.
That's how you lost the girl.
And now you say,

"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever),
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)."

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah)

And you could know (oh-oh oh oh)
That I don't want you to go oh-oh..

Remind me how it used to be.
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
And say you want me.
Yeah...

And then you say,

"I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better),
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I want you forever and ever."

[4x]
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl.
Oh.

That's how it works.
That's how you got the girl.

----- this love -----

Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams,
in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you're still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip,
oh, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]

Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... 

----- i know places -----

You stand with your hand on my waist line
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out 

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time 

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places 

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places

----- clean -----

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean

10 months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Think I'm finally clean

----- wonderland -----

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole.

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control.

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night.

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed.

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams.

Oh

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.

But darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

----- you are in love -----

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burn toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says
You're my best friend
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You can feel it on the way home, way home
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

----- new romantics -----

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded,
It's so romantic

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

----- ready for it? -----

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holding him for ransom, some
Some boys are trying too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor (hey!)
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure (hey)
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I-I-I see how this is gon' go (go)
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low (low)
No one has to know
(No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Ooh
Are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (in my dreams)
You should see the things we do,(we do) baby,(baby) hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time

In the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

----- end game -----

[Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation (git, git)
Ah, and I heard about you
Ooh, You like the bad ones, too (yeah)

[Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (yeah)
I'm in a G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it, too 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down, and I protect you with my life (my life)

[Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee-deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you, I don't wanna miss you
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Aah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (hey!)
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Aah, and I heard about you
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too

[Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang! We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Taylor Swift, Future & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (me and you) (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now) (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (oh, I do!) (end game)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

----- i did something bad -----

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look, oh so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly him all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it coming what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says: Don't throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name then I owe him nothing
And if he spends my change then he had it coming

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up, light me up, light me up
Go ahead and light me up
Light me up, light me up, light me up, light me up

They say I did something bad (bad)
Then why's it feel so good? (so good)
They say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, (good) good

Oh, you say I did something bad (bad)
But why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good?
It just felt so good, good

----- don't blame me -----

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh-whoah-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

[Outro]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

----- delicate -----

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
('Cause I like you)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
('Cause I like you)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?

----- look what you made me do -----

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me—)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

----- so it goes -----

[Verse 1]
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

[Bridge]
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting? (One, two, three)

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place (Pieces fall)
Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
I do bad things with you
So it goes…
[Refrain]
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

----- gorgeous -----

[Intro]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous

----- getaway car -----

[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We’re both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

----- king of my heart -----

[Verse 1]
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "Baby" like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once
[Verse 2]
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once
[Bridge]
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

----- dancing with our hands tied -----

[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

[Chorus]
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)

----- dress -----

[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about—
[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha...

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops...
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Outro]
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

----- this is why we can't have nice things -----

[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

----- call it what you want -----

[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want... to

----- new year's day -----

[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

----- i forgot that you existed -----

[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show
[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah

----- cruel summer -----

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil
[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

----- lover -----

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

----- the man -----

[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I’d be the man
I'd be the man

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)
[Outro]
If I was a man, then I'd be the man

----- the archer -----

[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay
[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat

----- i think he knows -----

[Verse 1]
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)
[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

[Bridge]
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows
[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows

----- miss americana and the heart break prince -----

[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know

[Outro]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"

----- paper rings -----

[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Outro]
You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

----- cornelia street -----

[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

[Outro]
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

----- death by a thousand cuts -----

[Intro]
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?
[Chorus]
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

----- london boy -----

[Intro: Idris Elba & James Corden]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)
[Outro]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

----- soon you'll get better -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
[Bridge: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]
Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

----- false god -----

[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah
[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

----- you need to calm down -----

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

----- afterglow -----

[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

----- me -----

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like
[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

----- it's nice to have a friend -----

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

----- daylight -----

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)
[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

----- the 1 -----

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

----- cardigan -----

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

----- the last great american diynasty -----

[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time

----- exile -----

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

----- my tears ricochet -----

[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

----- mirrorball -----

[Verse 1]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

----- seven -----

[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Bridge]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
[Verse 2]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long

----- august -----

[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

----- this is me trying -----

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying

----- illicit affairs -----

[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times

----- invisible string -----

[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)

------ mad woman -----

[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that

----- epiphany -----

[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)
[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

----- betty -----

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

----- peace -----

[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

----- hoax -----

[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

----- willow -----

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

----- ​champagne problems -----

[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

----- ​gold rush -----

[Intro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

[Outro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

----- ​'tis the damn season -----

[Verse 1]
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
[Outro]
It always leads to you and my hometown

----- ​tolerate it -----

[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
[Bridge]
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

[Chorus 2]
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Outro]
I sit and watch you

----- ​no body, no crime -----

[Intro: HAIM]
He did it
He did it

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

[Outro: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died

----- happiness -----

[Verse 1]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

----- dorothea -----

[Verse 1]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

[Chorus]
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything

[Verse 2]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show

[Chorus]
But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)
Dorothea (Ah-ah)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah

----- ​coney island -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold

----- ivy -----

[Verse 1]
How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours
[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you
[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you
In you

----- cowboy like me -----

[Verse 1]
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Chorus]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Verse 3]
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

[Chorus]
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me

[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Chorus]
You're a cowboy like me

[Post-Chorus 1]
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
[Post-Chorus 2]
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Bridge]
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

[Verse 4]
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

[Chorus]
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
[Outro]
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again

----- long story short -----

[Verse 1]
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready
[Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Bridge]
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

[Verse 3]
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you
(And now) Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

[Outro]
Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived

[Verse 1]
Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Verse 2]
Never be so politе
You forget your power
Nevеr wield such power
You forget to be polite
[Pre-Chorus]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around

[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Bridge]
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me
[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

[Outro]
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around

----- closure -----

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure

[Verse 2]
Don't treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears, and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing bettеr
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your lеtter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, your closure
Your closure, your closure
[Bridge]
I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary

[Chorus]
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, closure, your closure
Your closure

----- evermore -----

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

[Bridge 1: Justin Vernon]
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

[Bridge 2: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore

----- more -----

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

wahooahoo

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not cause were just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on youtube

Cause, Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancingI wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy, 
Thinking about him

I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]

There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be

[Chorus]

I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right nowSometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for loveAmerican boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the dream of an american boy

American boy, raising little babies
hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
that's grown up, american boy

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
the hope of an american boyWell, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girlAngelinas got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
Ive never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I dont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
Hes got everything youd wanna be
Hes funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I wont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But aint it funny how
It all comes out
Isnt life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say

Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean,
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?

At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

Oh, yeah, yeah

You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge - Taylor Swift (Kendrick Lamar):]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

Eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyesAll is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my babyHer hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
Hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you, she'll unease you
Just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you when she snows you
She knows you, she's got Bette Davis EyesI live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

All my friends are saying 
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, 
you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone

All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know betterHere you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
BreathlessEmily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."

She said, "I wish there was some way
To make them stop it."
So he drives down to
That principles office and says,

"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down.
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out.
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile.
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
And he said,

"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down.
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out.
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile.
So don't let nobody take that away.
You weren't brought up that way."

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's officer Tate."
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident.
You better come down here right away.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
And Emily  she's fading fast."

He says, "God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down.
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground.
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile.
So please don't take that away.
It won't be easy taking her today.
She wasn't brought up that way."

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyesI had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say 
I'm looking good

But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number; just in case
I still miss you
And i still love you
By the way
By the way, ohAny day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well thats good enough for me
Dont need the real thing
Thats just another thing 
For me to try to tame
Dont know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

Before I met him 
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But Ill never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see meI'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus:]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus]

Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier.Ive been counting days and
Ive been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
Ive been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
Cause Ive been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if youve seen one
Id like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonightHe said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue TennesseeShe walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you?
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

He kissed his wife good bye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said,
"We're here to die for our God."
He stood up and said, "That's funny,
'Cause my God died for me."

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you?
And didn't he pray too?

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down

And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you? Where were you?
And didn't they pray too?

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every dayMy momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew 
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eyeHere in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me 
When we started home it started to rain 
You put your coat around me 
We stood there in the road 
You held me so close 
But did you ever let go 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
The bitter sting of what we couldve been 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

In through the window I see her with you 
Im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry 
I guess the storm is over for you 
But look at the tears here in my eyes 
I just stood there like a ghost 
As you held her so close 
And as I let you go 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Love like this changes who you are 
Every kiss you gave me is a scar 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

All I need is to move on fast 
But all I want is to have you back 
And it just keeps falling 

Down came the rain 
Lightning and thunder 
We tried in vain 
To hold on to each other 
Winds of change blew you away from me 
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
The bitter sting of what we couldve been 
Just when our love was like a burning flame 
Down came the rain 

Down came the rain[Spoken:] You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey 

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated 

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.

Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

(Keep your eyes open [4x])

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes openIsn't it funny how many times we can say,
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car,
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh,

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me,
Fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on youSomeone struck a match against the night,
All I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.

For a while I thought that I could hold you,
But you were just a temporary high. 

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free,
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand,
I tried to catch you, but I can't 
Chase the wind

And just as I reach out to touch you,
I remind myself you were meant to fly.

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you,  firefly
FireflyMy name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kinda scared 'cause
I never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
And she says that

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
An' I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
But none of us want to get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we doWish I had concentrated,
They said love was complicated,
But it's something i just fell into, 

And it was over-rated
But just look what i've created
I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue

Before you ask me if i'm alright, 
Think about what i, 
Had to do-oo, yeah

Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess i didn't plan, 
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me, 
Wish you could only see, 
I've got an i heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand.

I'd be fine if you just walked by, 
But you had to talk about why, 
You were wrong and i was right, 

But i can't believe you made me, 
Sit at home and cry like a baby, 
Wait right by the phone every night, 

And now you ask about you and i, 
There's no you and i, 
Remember what you put me through, 
I had to, 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Fix my heart put on my make-up, 
Another mess i didn't plan, 
And i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an i heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand 

And when you're home alone at night, 
You'll still wonder 
Why you took everything i had, oh baby
I had a lot about you and i, 
There's no you and i, 
And i know, 
Someday you will...

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planed, 

And you'll know you didn't beat me, 
When you look down and see, 
I've got an i heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand, 

Written on the back of my hand
An i heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand[Taylor Swift:]
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm) trouble, trouble, trouble ([Sammy Adams:] you know I'm)

Double platinum wherever she go
South of France to Reno
Met her out in Vegas
Went in on casino 
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad, bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate...just yet
Slow down, I know that 
You thinking you and me...just met 
But girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy

Some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
And ya feel the same way, same way 
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man 
I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn
And I can care less that your famous
We can make the perfect couple
Cause my first name big, last name trouble
Yeah

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

Bigger than the rest
So I can see

Dont try me

You be you and Ill be me

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out

Your mum and daddys walls
Are covered up in pictures of you

You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into

So sorry, dont worry

Who love you like you do

And it aint youI... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the skyThrowing pennies at the fountain, 
When you're standing on a mountain, 
It's kinda hard to aim. 

But like the trees we cut our names in, 
There must be an explanation, 
Guess it didn't given off rain. 
I need reasons why you're leaving 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
I thought was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really from your heart 
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought was a star. 

Diving off into the deep end, 
Honestly believe you'd be there, 
When I jumped in, 
Is ain't your territory, 
We had the perfect love story, 
except ending. 
Nothing comes true, 
When it comes to you. 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really from your heart 
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star. 

And I was too cloudy, 
It's not my fault I just couldn't see. 

[Chorus:]
Well I guess I wished on a plane, 
I thought it was a star, 
I guess what you wrote on a paper 
Wasn't really in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me 
I guess heard you wrong 
And I guess I wished on a plane 
And I thought it was a star. 

Throwing pennies at the fountain, 
When you're standing on a mountain, 
It's kinda hard to aim.I dont think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
Hell never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs
And...

[Chorus:]
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
Id lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldnt a light go on?
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine

[Chorus]

He stands there, then walks away
My god if I could only say,
"Im holding every breath for you..."

Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is "My god, hes beautiful."
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
Id lieShe didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing whyI got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ohCome on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went outThere's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you

Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you ain't so far away

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky youYour feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

Do you know when you go 
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Made Up You

Oh oh

Made Up YouHe's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine

People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolinMe and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
Or where else to go

Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

Oh, oh
Were not as young, but were still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when were old, were still gonna be

Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shadeI like glitter and sparkly dresses,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la, la la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might think I'd bring up Joe,
The guy who broke up with me on the phone,
But I'm not gonna mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well,
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

And if you're wondering if I might,
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
(Hi Taylor!)
I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue.....

But there's nothing more to say
Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la
That was my SNL monologueI know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
if you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

wherever you think I am tonight 
just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye 
I'll be right where you are baby

sometime along the way you take my breath away
distracted by he view
I fall right into you

and if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

they say I need to see all the people out there waiting
but you take one look at me
and I know the mistake I'd be making

cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say between now and foreverSomething about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

It's my turn to be meOn a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing though a valley
Tearing up a good July

I'm going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good July

Going back to Nashville

I'm going back to Nashville

Going back to Naaaaahh....

Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My worlds a little colder now
But Im keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street

You need me now
Thats what youve been telling my friends
That Ive come too far to go back there again

My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
So whos gonna hold you
I dont need you now
And I dont know where you are
I dont wonder where you are
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now

I dont dream about the way
That I never heard you say
I need you I need you
I dont need you now

Dont need you
Dont need you nowI think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fadeLook at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mindIt wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skinStanding on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everythingOh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin'
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were callin my name 
When your face faded from view

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doin' nothin'
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?

Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night 
Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, ohI know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'cause I'm not trying to show maturity

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah

Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

In permanent marker

Gonna give you what you gave to meI was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrongI remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and backI remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)
La La (La La)
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light,
You and I'll be safe and sound...

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh oh ohLet's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still throught
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleamin
As my eyes went wild
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nightsDays go by, I wonder if you here me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing 
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is youLet me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.
I was gonna be everything you need
'Cause you're everything to me

So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skinTire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Whistle County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times

I remember.........

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was,
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while,
And I still think about back when.."

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeahHit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction

I'll be one of the many saying,
"Look at you now, look at you now, now."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"Look at you now, look at you now, now."
I'll be one of the many saying,
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud."

And when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyeswider than distance
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fictionIt was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes how to know to look right through me
It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

Take time to realize I know
That people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say
To my face
But you run away

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
Yeah Yeah

Tell me what did I do
Because baby suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
And tell me

Ooooh Yeah
Tell me
Tell MeYou were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six packIm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah whats the word on you
Lay low Im a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Im poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
Im a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I dont get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

Its raining on Sunday
Theres nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
Youre the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I cant stop thinking about you
I bet youre thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page its all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of meShould have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear john, 
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus:]
There's your trouble, 
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you, 
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking, 
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, 
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

[Repeat chorus]

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Repeat chorus]Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that dont offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if theyre half as stubborn as me
Theyll just keep on shining bright
I aint ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling aint strong
Ill just move on
And leave this in my past

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill act today
Until you find somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still dont know
Oh and it troubles me so

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
And Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smileWalking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

Were you a present from a father to a son
Did he forget you 
Or just play you 'til you came undone
Hey did some prima donna love you 
'Til she got her fame and fortune
I won't do that to you

Nice to meet you, I can teach you
All I know, you can show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
And I played you for endless hours
Never left you in the corner
You're my one and only friend
Now I know where life lessons are
This here guitar

You're my guitar

This here guitarBeneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
Its like Im melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
and

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me everyday
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still cant take my eyes off you

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh Baby,Here we are

Tell me
Youll never leave me
and Im not crazy and
Oh,This is really happening
Oh,Oh,Baby

Tell me
Youll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh,that this is really happening

Tell me,Oh
Youll always need me
(need me,tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening[T-Pain:]

[Taylor Swift:]
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
I had a dream last night

[Taylor Swift:]
I had high top Nikes
I had

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
Diamonds in my mouth 
And Diamonds on my mic

[Taylor Swift:]
By the time I woke I was singing

[Taylor Swift (T-Pain):]
What, What, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, What, Don't test me (Beep)
Hey, Hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything I- (What?)
I said Yo (yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear (She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you

When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes alongToday was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Yeah yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Instrumental]

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh

Today was a fairytaleAre you trying to make me fall
'Cause with a face like that baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up 
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me 
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Na na na na na na na na na 
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh.. 

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my headI used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the worldIf you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look nowWe used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We Were Happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy

Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happyI got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy 
When I let too much go
Loves a little messy and you are too
Right now Im scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray 
Swore Id never let a man in my way

Youre the last thing I needed today

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee 
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Cant talk to my friends 
Without you coming up
Its even kind of cute 
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down 
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good 
Right next to mine

Youre the last thing I needed tonight

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

Im acting like a girl 
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring 
About anything but you

And I dont know 
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between 
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in 
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh ohWhat do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know its real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say?
What do you say?

What do you say?
What do you say?She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it

Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life

First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again

Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

Ohh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wearYou walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words i wrote down on a page,
When i was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues,
I tell them, "this is what I do"
And its what i put my life into,
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games

So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always beenI can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind 
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really ok cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be 
Over you for real 
Until I do

I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really ok when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do, 
I'll keep writing songs about youI bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

[Chorus:]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want...
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

[Chorus]

It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
but for someone like you it's just so easy to do

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need

If that's what you need

[Chorus]I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And i know that if i turn around you won't be there
If i close my eyes will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And i hope it never falls
And i hope i never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now i wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish i could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And i had you

I don't wanna lose your face
And i don't wanna wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And i don't wanna turn around
Coz i'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And i don't wanna lose your face
